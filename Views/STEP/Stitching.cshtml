    <h2 class="text-primary">The Role of Women in the Handicraft Industry</h2>
    <p>
        Women have played a vital role in the handicraft industry throughout history, and their involvement in this industry has deep cultural and social significance. Handicrafts have been a way for women to express their creativity and preserve cultural heritage, and they have also provided women with economic opportunities and a means of supporting themselves and their families.

        Historically, women have been the primary producers and sellers of handicrafts, with many traditional handicrafts being passed down from mothers to daughters. Women's involvement in the handicraft industry has helped to preserve traditional techniques and cultural practices, ensuring that they are passed down from generation to generation.

        Moreover, women have contributed significantly to the development and growth of the handicraft industry. They have played a crucial role in creating unique and high-quality products that are valued both for their artistic and functional qualities. Women have also been instrumental in creating new markets for handicrafts and expanding the industry's reach beyond local communities.

        Data and statistics demonstrate the importance of women's contributions to the handicraft industry. According to the International Trade Centre, women account for 70% of the global handicraft workforce. In some countries, such as India and Bangladesh, women make up more than 80% of the handicraft workforce. Moreover, handicrafts are often a significant source of income for women, particularly in rural areas where there are few other economic opportunities. The United Nations estimates that the handicraft industry generates up to $32 billion annually, with women making up a significant portion of this revenue.
